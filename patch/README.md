# Patches awaiting a push with the `workflow` scope

A change under `.github/workflows/` can only be pushed by a credential
that holds GitHub's `workflow` scope. When a writing session does not
have that scope, the change travels here instead as a patch against
`main`, for a maintainer to apply and push.

Remove the patch in the same change that applies it, so this folder
holds only what is still pending.

## Pending patches

None.
